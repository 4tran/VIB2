# VIB2

## General information
This is the rewrite of VIB (Vanilla imageboard.)

Originally, I had wanted to create an imageboard software using as little third-party software as possible. Well, I successfully did that, and you can see the result for yourself in the original VIB. 

The point of that for me was to force myself to truly learn php. Now that I've accomplished that, albeit maybe not perfectly, I've decided to move to the next stage of software development: attempting making something that's actually good.

I still believe in simplicity and doing as much of my own coding as I can, but I also now see that there are lots of good resources available to me, and that rewriting every possible segment of code is neither efficient, nor is it particularly tidy.

So, with this project, I will be using libraries as I see fit, but I won't be using an entire framework, as I see that as mostly unnecessary bulkiness that I wouldn't be able to fully utilize anyway.

## Installation
Configure config.php in /res/ to your specifications. Ensure the database you select is empty, or the data in it could be overwritten. Then navigate to install.php in your browser, and the necessary tables will be created. From there, navigate to mod.php to set up boards and and users and such. The default admin login combination is admin/admin.
